# Meraki_Suite
"meraki_config.py" is an automation tool that allows you to create a Meraki network from scratch. All you'll need to do is supply the network name, timezone it exists in, and any IP address information the VLANs will use. The script will configure the following by default, with options for you to change things as needed for your environment:
  1. VLANs
  2. DHCP
  3. SNMP
  4. Firewall rules
  5. per-port access settings
  6. site-to-site VPN settings and ACLs
